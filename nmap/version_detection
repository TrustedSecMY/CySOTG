Version Detection

1. Operating System Detection (-O): 
    This option instructs Nmap to perform operating system detection against the target host(s) based on various characteristics such as TCP/IP stack behavior, 
    responses to certain probes, and other factors.

    Command: nmap -O 192.168.0.1

2. Submit TCP/IP Fingerprints:
    This option is a URL provided by Nmap where users can submit TCP/IP fingerprints collected during scans. 
    These fingerprints help improve Nmap's accuracy in detecting and identifying operating systems.

    Command: www.nmap.org/submit/Fingerprints

3. Attempt to Guess an Unknown OS (-O --osscan-guess): 
    In addition to performing regular OS detection, 
    this option instructs Nmap to make an educated guess about the operating system in cases where it cannot determine the OS definitively.

    Command: nmap -O --osscan-guess 192.168.0.1

4. Service Version Detection (-sV): 
    This option enables service version detection, which involves probing open ports to determine the versions of services running on those ports. 
    It can help identify software vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.

    Command: nmap -sV 192.168.0.1

5. Troubleshooting Version Scans (-sV --version-trace): 
    This option provides detailed tracing information during service version detection, 
    helping to troubleshoot any issues encountered during the version detection process.

    Command: nmap -sV --version-trace 192.168.0.1

6. Perform an RPC Scan (-sR): 
    This option instructs Nmap to perform an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) scan, 
    which is used to identify RPC services running on the target system. 
    It can help identify potential vulnerabilities in RPC-based services.

    Command: nmap -sR 192.168.0.1
