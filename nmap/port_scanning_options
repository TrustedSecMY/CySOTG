Port Scanning Options
Port scanning options in Nmap allow you to customize the scanning process to target specific ports, 
protocols, or scan types.

1. Perform a Fast Scan (-F): 
    This option instructs Nmap to perform a fast scan, also known as a quick scan or fast mode scan. 
    It scans only the most common ports, significantly reducing the scan time.

    Command: nmap -F 192.168.0.1

2. Scan Specific Ports (-p): 
    This option allows you to specify a comma-separated list of ports or port ranges to scan. 
    It's useful when you want to focus on specific services or ports of interest.

    Command: nmap -p 21-25,80,139,8080 192.168.1.1

3. Scan Ports by Name (-p): 
    Instead of specifying port numbers directly, 
    you can use service names or wildcard patterns to scan ports associated with specific services.
  
    Command: nmap -p ftp,http* 192.168.0.1

4. Scan Ports by Protocol (-sU, -sT, -p): 
    This example shows how to scan specific ports using both TCP (-sT) and UDP (-sU) protocols. 
    It scans UDP ports 53, 111, and 137, as well as TCP ports 21-25, 80, 139, and 8080.

    Command: nmap -sU -sT -p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080 192.168.0.1

5. Scan All Ports (-p): 
    Using an asterisk (*) with the -p option tells Nmap to scan all 65535 ports. 
    This can be useful for comprehensive scans but may significantly increase scan time.

    Command: nmap -p '*' 192.168.0.1

6. Scan Top Ports (--top-ports): 
    This option scans the most common ports according to the specified number. 
    In this example, it scans the top 10 ports.

    Command: nmap --top-ports 10 192.168.0.1

9. Perform a Sequential Port Scan (-r): 
    This option performs a sequential port scan rather than the default random order. 
    It scans ports sequentially from the lowest to the highest.

    Command: nmap -r 192.168.0.1
