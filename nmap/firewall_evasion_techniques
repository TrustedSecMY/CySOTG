Firewall Evasion Techniques

1. Fragment Packets (-f): 
    This option causes Nmap to split TCP packets into smaller fragments, 
    making it harder for firewalls to detect and block the scan. 
    Some firewalls may only inspect the first fragment of a packet, 
    allowing subsequent fragments to pass through unnoticed.

    Command: nmap -f 192.168.0.1

2. Specify a Specific MTU (--mtu): 
    This option allows you to set a specific Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size for the scan. 
    It can be useful for evading firewalls that perform packet size filtering.

    Command: nmap --mtu 32 192.168.0.1

3. Use a Decoy (-D): 
    This option enables decoy scanning, 
    where Nmap sends forged packets from decoy IP addresses in addition to the real source IP address. 
    This can make it more difficult for firewalls to detect and block the true source of the scan.

    Command: nmap -D RND:10 192.168.0.1

4. Idle Zombie Scan (-sI): 
    This scan technique involves using a "zombie" host (a compromised host) as a proxy to scan the target. 
    Since the scan originates from the zombie host, it can evade detection by the target's firewall.
  
    Command: nmap -sI 192.168.0.38

5. Manually Specify a Source Port (--source-port): 
    By manually specifying the source port of the scan, you can evade firewall rules that only allow traffic from specific ports.

    Command: nmap --source-port 10 192.168.0.1

6. Append Random Data (--data-length): 
    This option adds random data to the packets sent during the scan. 
    It can help evade signature-based detection systems by making the packets appear more random.

    Command: nmap --data-length 2 192.168.0.1

7. Randomize Target Scan Order (--randomize-hosts): 
    This option randomizes the order in which targets are scanned, 
    making it harder for firewalls to detect and block the scanning activity based on IP addresses.
  
    Command: nmap --randomize-hosts 192.168.0.1-20

8. Spoof MAC Address (--spoof-mac): 
    This option allows you to spoof the MAC address of the scanning device, 
    which can help evade MAC address-based filters on the network.

    Command: nmap --spoof-mac Cisco 192.168.0.1

9. Send Bad Checksums (--badsum): 
    This option sends packets with intentionally incorrect checksums. 
    While this may cause some network stacks to drop the packets, 
    it can also evade some IDS/IPS systems that rely on checksum verification.

    Command: nmap --badsum 192.168.0.1
