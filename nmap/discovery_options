Discovery Options

1. Perform a Ping Only Scan (-sP): 
    This option is used when you only want to determine which hosts are online without performing any port scanning. 
    It sends ICMP echo requests (ping) to the target(s) and lists the responsive hosts.

    Command: nmap -sP 192.168.0.1

2. Donâ€™t Ping (-PN): 
    This option skips the initial ping scan and assumes that all specified targets are online. 
    It can be useful when ICMP echo requests are blocked or when you want to scan hosts that don't respond to ping requests.

    Command: nmap -PN 192.168.0.1

3. TCP SYN Ping (-PS):
    This type of ping sends TCP SYN packets to the specified ports on the target(s). 
    If a SYN-ACK packet is received in response, it means the port is open, and the target is likely online.

    Command: nmap -PS 192.168.0.1

4. TCP ACK Ping (-PA):
    Similar to SYN ping, this method sends TCP ACK packets to the target(s).
    It's often used when SYN packets are blocked by firewalls.

    Command: nmap -PA 192.168.0.1

5. UDP Ping (-PU):
    This sends UDP packets to the specified ports on the target(s) to check for responsiveness.
    It's useful for hosts that might not respond to ICMP requests.

    Command: nmap -PU 192.168.0.1

6. SCTP INIT Ping (-PY):
    Sends SCTP INIT packets to the target(s). 
    This is useful for scanning hosts that support the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

    Command: nmap -PY 192.168.0.1

7. ICMP Echo Ping (-PE):
    This sends ICMP echo request packets (ping) to the target(s) and waits for ICMP echo reply packets.
    It's one of the most common ping methods.

    Command: nmap -PE 192.168.0.1

8. ICMP Timestamp Ping (-PP):
    Sends ICMP timestamp request packets to the target(s) and waits for ICMP timestamp reply packets.

    Command: nmap -PP 192.168.0.1

ICMP Address Mask Ping (-PM): Sends ICMP address mask request packets to the target(s) and waits for ICMP address mask reply packets.

bash
Copy code
nmap -PM 192.168.0.1
IP Protocol Ping (-PO): Sends IP protocol packets to the target(s) and waits for responses. It can help identify which IP protocols are supported by the target(s).

bash
Copy code
nmap -PO 192.168.0.1
ARP Ping (-PR): This method uses ARP requests to determine if hosts are online within the local network segment. It's particularly useful for local network scans.

bash
Copy code
nmap -PR 192.168.0.1
Traceroute (--traceroute): This option performs a traceroute to the target(s), showing the path packets take to reach the target(s), including the IP addresses of intermediate routers.

bash
Copy code
nmap --traceroute 192.168.0.1
Force Reverse DNS Resolution (-R): Forces Nmap to perform reverse DNS resolution for each scanned IP address, displaying the resolved domain names in the output.

bash
Copy code
nmap -R 192.168.0.1
Disable Reverse DNS Resolution (-n): This option tells Nmap not to perform reverse DNS resolution, which can speed up the scanning process.

bash
Copy code
nmap -n 192.168.0.1
Alternative DNS Lookup (--system-dns): Uses the system's DNS resolver instead of Nmap's internal DNS resolver.

bash
Copy code
nmap --system-dns 192.168.0.1
Manually Specify DNS Server(s) (--dns-servers): Allows you to manually specify DNS servers to use for reverse DNS resolution.

bash
Copy code
nmap --dns-servers 201.56.212.54 192.168.0.1
Create a Host List (-sL): This option simply lists the target(s) without performing any actual scanning. It's useful for generating a list of hosts for further analysis.

bash
Copy code
nmap -sL 192.168.0.1/24
