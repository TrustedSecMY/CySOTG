Troubleshooting And Debugging

1. Getting Help (-h): 
    This option displays the help menu, providing information about Nmap's usage, command-line options, and syntax.

    Command: nmap -h

2. Display Nmap Version (-V): 
    This option displays the version of Nmap installed on the system.

    Command: nmap -V

3. Verbose Output (-v): 
    This option increases the verbosity of Nmap's output, providing more detailed information about the scanning process, 
    including open ports, service versions, and scan progress.

    Command: nmap -v 192.168.0.1

4. Debugging (-d): 
    This option enables debugging mode, which provides even more detailed information about the scanning process, 
    including packet traces and internal operations.

    Command: nmap -d 192.168.0.1

5. Display Port State Reason (--reason): 
    This option displays the reason why a port is in a particular state (open, closed, filtered, etc.), 
    providing insight into the scan results.

    Command: nmap --reason 192.168.0.1

6. Only Display Open Ports (--open): 
    This option instructs Nmap to only display ports that are determined to be open during the scan, 
    filtering out closed and filtered ports from the output.

    Command: nmap --open 192.168.0.1

7. Trace Packets (--packet-trace): 
    This option traces the packets sent and received during the scan, 
    providing detailed information about the network communication involved in the scanning process.
  
    Command: nmap --packet-trace 192.168.0.1

8. Display Host Networking (--iflist): 
    This option displays information about the network interfaces available on the scanning system, 
    including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and interface names.

    Command: nmap --iflist

9. Specify a Network Interface (-e): 
    This option allows you to specify a network interface to use for the scan. 
    It's useful when scanning from a system with multiple network interfaces.

    Command: nmap -e eth0 192.168.0.1
