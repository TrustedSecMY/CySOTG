NMAP Scripting Engine

1. Execute Individual Scripts: 
    This option allows you to run a single Nmap script against a target host. 
    In this example, the script "banner.nse" is executed against the target host 192.168.0.1. 
    This script might gather information about banners (service identification information) from the target's open ports.

    Command: nmap –script banner.nse 192.168.0.1

2. Execute Multiple Scripts:
    You can execute multiple scripts using wildcards or specific script names. 
    In this example, all scripts starting with "http-" will be executed against the target host 192.168.0.1. 
    This can be useful for targeting specific services or protocols.

    Command: nmap –script 'http-*' 192.168.0.1

3. Script Categories: 
    Nmap categorizes scripts into different categories based on their functionality. 
    The available categories are:
      a) all
      b) auth
      c) default
      d) discovery
      e) external
      f) intrusive
      g) malware
      h) safe
      i) vuln

4. Execute Scripts by Category: 
    You can execute scripts belonging to a specific category using this option. 
    In this example, all scripts categorized as "not intrusive" will be executed against the target host 192.168.0.1. 
    This can be useful for targeting specific types of vulnerabilities or behaviors.

    Command: nmap –script 'not intrusive' 192.168.0.1

5. Execute Multiple Script Categories: 
    Similarly, you can execute scripts belonging to multiple categories by specifying them separated by "or". 
    In this example, scripts categorized as "default" or "safe" will be executed against the target host 192.168.0.1.

    Command: nmap –script 'default or safe' 192.168.0.1

6. Troubleshoot Scripts: 
    This option enables script tracing, which helps in troubleshooting script execution issues. 
    In this example, the script "banner.nse" will be executed against the target host 192.168.0.1, 
    and additional debugging information will be provided to aid in troubleshooting.
  
    Command: nmap –script banner.nse –script-trace 192.168.0.1

7. Update the Script Database: 
    This option updates the NSE script database to ensure you have the latest scripts and improvements. 
    Running this command periodically ensures that you have access to the most up-to-date scripts for your security assessments.

    Command: nmap –script-updatedb
